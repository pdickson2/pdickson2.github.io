In weeks 5 and 6 we transitioned back to QGIS and utilized its Database Manager and POSTGIS functions to analyze openstreetmap data collected through the Rumani Huria Project in Dar es Salaam.

In week 5 we created sql code so we could create a visualization of the percentage of buildings flooded within the subwards of Dar es Salaam.  The data for the buildings and subwards used in this analysis came from resilience academy, a product of the Rumani Huria Project.

The following is the visualization of our final map, produced through leaflet in QGIS, in which the water and subwards can be visualized together and separately.
