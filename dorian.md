Our final lab looked at the realtionship of tweets about Hurricane Dorian in the context of the actual path of the hurricane versus the projected path proposed on President Trump's twitter during 'sharpiegate'.

We conducted analysis in RStudio which then allowed us to statistically analyze the presence of tweets on Dorian specifically versus general twitter activity.  Following the gathering and initial analysis of data in R, we transitioned to PostGIS in QGIS to conduct statistical analysis on the data gathered initially.  Finally we picture these statistical results in GeoDa, which allows a final visualization of the effect (or lack of) which 'sharpiegate' had on tweets conducted during this period.

Below are images of the most popular language which occurred during the storm in tweets and a visualization of the associations between these keywords.
