## My First QGIS Model

In the first lab, we created a model to calculate the distance and direction from a point.

[Direction and Distance Model](DisDirModel.model3)

Visualization of the Model

From there, we created plots of median gross income and hispanic populations as a function of distance and direction.  See below plots of these measures as visualized in Milwaukee.  

The first plot relates distance from the city center and median gross rent in Milwaukee by census tract.

The second plot relates direction from the city center and hispanic/latinx population in Milwaukee by census tract.
