## My First QGIS Model

In the first lab, we created a model to calculate the distance and direction from a point.

[Direction and Distance Model](DisDirModel.model3)

This model was used to analyze the relationship between distance and direction from the city center, as calculated by finding the centroid of four tracts estimated near to the central business district, and the median gross income and hispanic/latinx populations of the tracts. The data for this study of Milwaukee can be found [here](Milwaukee.gpkg).   

From there, we created plots of median gross income and hispanic populations as a function of distance and direction.  See below plots of these measures as visualized in Milwaukee.  

The first plot relates distance from the city center and median gross rent in Milwaukee by census tract.

The second plot relates direction from the city center and hispanic/latinx population in Milwaukee by census tract.
