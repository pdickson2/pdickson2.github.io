##My First QGIS Model

In the first lab, we created a model to calculate the distance and direction from a point.

[Direction and Distance Model](DisDirModel.model3)

From there, we created plots of median gross income and hispanic populations as a function of distance and direction.  See below plots of these measures as visualized in Milwaukee.
