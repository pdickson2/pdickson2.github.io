In anticipation of utilizing twitter data spatially, we looked at the available academic literature on the subject.  I looked at a piece written about the correlations between tweet content and locations and traffic patterns, specifically of crashes.  The article can be found (here)[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2017.06.012] for context.

The work looked at 


purpose, hypothesis, or question: is it deductive or inductive?
source of twitter data, including query parameters if known
is the research reproducible? (can you get the same data and produce the same results)
is the research replicable (can you apply it to a new case  and get similar findings/conclusions)?
do the packages/libraries  exist in R to accomplish the research? Search R + Library + keywords of techniques needed
